# Inverse_Methods-in-Heat-Transfer
• Implemented a Bayesian Algorithm with Metropolis Hastings and Markov Chain/Monte Carlo Sampling of heat transfer rate in
an Adiabatic fin in Python
• Implementation of GNA,LMA and Tikhonov Regualrization while solving for Heat transfer rate/ coeffcients in heat transfer problems
involving non linear Temperature Distribution in python.
